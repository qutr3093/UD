          <h2>About Yoshimoto Nara</h2>
          <p>
            Yoshitomo Nara is one of the most beloved contemporary Japanese
            artists. The protagonist in his works, a girl with big, wide eyes
            and often wearing an unhappy look or a sarcastic smile, strikes deep
            resonance among people, especially the young ones who see in the
            girl shared loneliness and growing pains and a rejection of the
            adults' world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yoshitomo Nara is a pioneering figure in contemporary art whose
            signature style—which expresses children in a range of emotional
            complexities from resistance and rebellion to quietude and
            contemplation—celebrates the introspective freedom of the
            imagination and the individual.

          <h2>Yoshitomo Nara, Miss Forest / Thinker, 2016</h2>
          <p>
            For Nara, the type of institution or the size of a space matters
            less than how connected he feels with its environment and his
            approach to art is similarly dependent on his sense of connection
            with its making. In 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake and
            Tsunami greatly affected Nara’s worldview and impacted the work he
            made after that time. Still bearing the style he had developed
            throughout his oeuvre, this later work marked a thoughtfulness and
            pathos that seemed to reflect on themes such as impermanence,
            temporality, beauty, and the present. In the Milky Lake/Thinking One
            (2011), the first painting he made after the disaster, exudes the
            meditative and thoughtful figures that marked a shift in his
            practice and could be seen in Thinker (2017), at Pace in New York,
            and Ceramic Works And… (2018), at Pace in Hong Kong.

          <h2>Yoshitomo Nara, 1.2.3.4., Change the History, 2007,</h2>
          <p>
            A year after Nara’s return to Japan in 2000, his seminal solo
            exhibition titled I DON’T MIND, IF YOU FORGET ME was mounted at the
            Yokohama Museum of Art and displayed Nara’s extensive
            multidisciplinary approach to artmaking. In addition to stuffed
            animals, sculptures, paintings, and drawings, the artist presented
            Fountain of Life (2001), a ceramic sculpture featuring running
            water, and Time of My Life (2001), his “drawing room” installation
            built out of plywood, lit with bare lightbulbs, and filled with
            drawings on paper and various ephemera. This installation would
            anticipate a series of collaborations with the design collective
            graf, such as Yoshitomo Nara + graf: Torre de Málaga (2007), a
            site-specific installation at the Centro de Arte Contemporáneo de
            Málaga in Spain. Torre de Málaga, a towering house, was built out of
            industrial and waste materials collected from the city and included
            the work 1.2.3.4, Change the History (2007), which Nara painted on
            site and mounted onto the tower. Evoking Nara’s spirit of
            collaboration and existential introspection, the exhibition carried
            an implicit criticism of the effects of industrialization and
            globalization.
